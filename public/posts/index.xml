      <description>Who am I? A -mainly- self-tought software engineer, loved computers since I was little, and trying my best to understand them and make them do amazing things.
I started programming after I got my first computer at the age of 13, and the rest is history.
I am fascinated with low-level, compiler design, and back-end related programming but I occasionally do some front-end and game dev work, which I may talk about on this blog.</description>
