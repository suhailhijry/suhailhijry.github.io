      <description>Background I&amp;rsquo;m omitting many details in this post, since parsing is a very broad topic, and diving into each point will be out of the scope of this post
A parser is usually that part of a compiler/program that translates some data into other form of data. It can be a CSV, JSON, YAML, or even a whole programming language parser. A parser follows a grammar, and just like any natural language, programming languages, data exchange formats, and even file formats have grammar rules.</description>

      <description>Who am I? A -mainly- self-tought software engineer, loved computers since I was little, and trying my best to understand them and make them do amazing things.
I started programming after I got my first computer at the age of 13, and the rest is history.
I am fascinated with low-level, compiler design, and back-end related programming but I occasionally do some front-end and game dev work, which I may talk about on this blog.</description>
