A parser is usually that part of a compiler/program that translates some data into other form of data. It can be a CSV, JSON, YAML, or even a whole programming language parser. A parser follows a grammar, and just like any natural language, programming languages, data exchange formats, and even file formats have grammar rules.</description></item><item><title>Hello, void!</title><link>https://suhailhijry.github.io/posts/hello/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Jul 2022 02:16:10 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://suhailhijry.github.io/posts/hello/</guid><description>Who am I? A -mainly- self-tought software engineer, loved computers since I was little, and trying my best to understand them and make them do amazing things.
I started programming after I got my first computer at the age of 13, and the rest is history.
I am fascinated with low-level, compiler design, and back-end related programming but I occasionally do some front-end and game dev work, which I may talk about on this blog.</description></item></channel></rss>
