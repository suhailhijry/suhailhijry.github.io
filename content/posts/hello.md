## Who am I?

A -mainly- self-tought software engineer, loved computers since I was little, and trying my best to understand them and make them do amazing things.

I started programming after I got my first computer at the age of 13, and the rest is history.

I am fascinated with low-level, compiler design, and back-end related programming but I occasionally do some front-end and game dev work, which I may talk about on this blog.

## Why this blog?

This isn't a new thing, as almost every software developer under the sun has a blog nowadays..but I am not aiming at creating tutorials, or explaining topics, but instead I'll try to document my journey and express my thoughts and opinions on computer-related topics.

As this is my first time writing (and my English is not fantastic either), do not expect high-quality or professional writing.
